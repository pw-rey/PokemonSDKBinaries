# Linux dependency policy

`config/linux-x86_64-sources.lock` uses `name sha256 source-url`, like the macOS
source lock. `.github/scripts/fetch-sources.sh` downloads and checks these archives;
the Docker builders check the hashes again before extraction. No runtime source
archive is selected through a moving `latest` URL.

The Linux workflow uses `litergss/build.sh` in this repository. It reuses the pinned
LiteRGSS staging script, but owns the dependency builds instead of inheriting the
upstream Dockerfile's old distribution libraries. RubyFMOD and SFEMovie's Ruby
binding reuse that image; the native sfeMovie image inherits it too.

Ruby/SFML major upgrades and an OpenAL compiler/toolchain migration require separate
compatibility work. FMOD remains the explicitly configured 2.02.20 SDK required
by the existing RubyFMOD binding. Component Git revisions remain in
`config/linux-x86_64.conf`, including SFMLAudio.

## Distribution and host dependencies

The manylinux base remains pinned by digest and retains glibc 2.28. The builder
runs `dnf upgrade --refresh` before installing build tools and system integration
headers. Fontconfig and its system configuration, Expat, JPEG, and ancillary
distribution libraries follow AlmaLinux's maintained packages, rather than
independent upstream source releases. Build tools and Ruby build gems also remain
outside the runtime source lock. This is not a complete RPM/toolchain lock or a
claim of bit-for-bit reproducibility.

A source-lock change invalidates the package-update Docker layer. To refresh
distribution packages alone when reusing local Docker caches, discard the cached
builder layers before the next local build.

The released `lib/psdk-runtime/` directory records `linux-sources.lock` and
`linux-distribution-packages.txt`. The latter is the full resolved builder RPM
inventory, not a list of libraries all bundled into the game.

Portable source libraries use the baseline `/usr/bin/gcc` and `/usr/bin/g++`.
OpenGL, X11, ALSA, and the C++ runtime continue to come from the player's system.
OpenSSL's shared libraries are bundled, while `setup.sh` selects the host CA
bundle and respects an explicitly set `SSL_CERT_FILE`.

The user ran the Linux workflow with `act`: assembly and the shared functional
suite passed in the glibc 2.28 container. The coding agent ran no builds or tests.
Local runs skip GitHub artifact upload and retain `dist/Linux-x86-64.7z`.
Run the Linux `act workflow_call` command in the repository README to exercise
the complete build and existing runtime checks.
